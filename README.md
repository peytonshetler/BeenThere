# BeenThere: Collect Cool Places

### Backstory
This is an iOS designed for the touring musician in mind. For the uninitiated, touring musicians typically spend very little time in one place. 
When they're on the road, a lot of times it can go like this: Monday in Nashville, Tuesday in Atlanta, Wednesday/Thursday in Charlotte, etc. Along the way,
you pick up some of your favorite spots in different cities: coffee shops, thrift shops. Here's the rub: as a touring musician, when I came back to cities I'd 
performed in previously, I could **never** remember the names of the places I went to. Voila, the idea for BeenThere was born.

### Solution
With BeenThere, users can search for business/places in the app using the Maps API, and then save that location to a collection.
Once saved, the users can filter through places according to location or category. Each place has a details screen that collects 
extra info gathered from maps, such as: phone number, directions, website, etc.

### Tech
Swift, UIKit, CoreData, Cloudkit, MVVM, Mapkit. (All programmatic UI, no storyboards üôåüèº)
